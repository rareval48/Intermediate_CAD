### Description & Images
This skateboard has many parts and have little parts and little details that you had to make sure were the right size and weight.

### Reflection
The Skateboard had diferent segments that you had to use to make the skateboard funcion. It was pretty easy and fun to customise and add your own colors and logos. First, you had to make the board, then the trucks, the wheels and bearings, and then you had to put it all together in an assembly. :neckbeard:

## 3.1-3.4 One Brick to Rule Them All

### Description & Images
This assignment was interesting and will be really useful in the future as I learned how to use variables and graphs to change the brick.

### Reflection
The Brick That Rules Them All is on of the most interesting assignments I have done so far. There are many things that I havent used that I had to use to complete this assignment. There are in total 54 different legos that can be made from the three different settings to make a brick with. Those include size, color, and block type.
