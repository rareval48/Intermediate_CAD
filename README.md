### Reflection
The Skateboard had diferent segments that you had to use to make the skateboard funcion. It was pretty easy and fun to customise and add your own colors and logos. First, you had to make the board, then the trucks, the wheels and bearings, and then you had to put it all together in an assembly. :neckbeard:
