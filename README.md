## Designing_The_Deck

### Description & Images
This skateboard deck was easy to build as it was just rectangle and circle sketches.

### Reflection
I learned you can connect both circle sketches to lines so when they are moved they are always connected. It only took a couple of minutes to make as it was really easy. Making the board was really simple when you follow instructions. I would say the hardest thing about this would be putting the screw holes in the right place as you had to make sure that they are correctly dimensioned.

## Designing_The_Trucks


### Description and Images 
Here is the end truck result.

### Reflection
The trucks had to be made a certain way for there to have a small ring in the middle to help strenghthen it. I had to remake the truck, because the first time that I tried to make it, I sketched on the wrong face and it didnt work once I started to make the second part of the trucks.

### Reflection 
The wheels and bearings were the easiest parts to make in this project althought I had a problem with the size of the bearing and it interfering with the sides of the wheel. To fix it I had to change the diameter and make it smaller for the sides of the bearing up against the wheel not on it. Once I fixed that, it went pretty smoothly after and from there I moved onto the next part of the project.

### Reflection
The Skateboard had diferent segments that you had to use to make the skateboard funcion. It was pretty easy and fun to customise and add your own colors and logos. First, you had to make the board, then the trucks, the wheels and bearings, and then you had to put it all together in an assembly. There are also more additions you can do to the skateboard like bending the board, making the trucks more realistic, changing the shape of the board, and adding a logo. :neckbeard:

## One_Brick_To_Rule_Them_All

### Description & Images
This assignment is making legos and  building a duck. There were little things that you had to do including making varialbes and graphs.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71342195/138289143-c76eb2ef-cb34-4f4a-907d-38d5d237de31.png"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71342195/138289448-4bc8b72f-717e-4845-8661-14251ca37e29.png"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71342195/138289561-a2604c6d-7a5d-44d8-be02-d8a956e8541b.png">

### Reflection
The Brick That Rules Them All is on of the most interesting assignments I have done so far. There are many things that I havent used that I had to use to complete this assignment. There are in total 54 different legos that can be made from the three different settings to make a brick with. Those include size, color, and block type. Using variables and graphs really made this easier as I didnt have to make seperate legos for a single assembly.

## Multi_Tool

### Description & Images
This is the end result of the the Multi-Tool

### Reflection
The Multi Tool was really easy to make as I have used all of the functions that I needed to make this product. One thing I learned from this project was from uploading it to Google. When I uploaded it the lines that were curved would disappear, but when you put the sketch onto a dfx reader then they would show back up. So in the future I learned not to worry when that happens again.
