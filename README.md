### Reflection
The Skateboard had diferent segments that you had to use to make the skateboard funcion. It was pretty easy and fun to customise and add your own clors and logos. First, you hd to make the board, then the trucks, then wheels and bearings, and then you had to put it all together in an assembly. :neckbeard:
